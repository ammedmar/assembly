\subsection*{Acknowledgement}

I would like to remember Andrew's kind and joyful personality, thanking him for the many enjoyable conversations we had during my graduate student years.
I am also indebted to Dennis Sullivan who introduced me to much of Andrew's work and suggested the ``Ranicki gambit'' as my thesis project, the technical core of which is the result presented here.
Andrew's mathematics and character had a formative influence on me and on many others.
He will be missed.
