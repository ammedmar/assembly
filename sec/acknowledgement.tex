\subsection*{Acknowledgement}

I am grateful to Peter Teichner and Michael Weiss for their questions and comments regarding this project.

I would like to take this opportunity to remember Andrew's kind and joyful personality which I enjoyed during many pleasant conversations as a graduate student.
I am also indebted to Dennis Sullivan who introduced me to Andrew's work and suggested the ``Ranicki gambit'' as my thesis project.
Andrew's mathematics and character had a formative influence on me and on many others.
He will be missed.
