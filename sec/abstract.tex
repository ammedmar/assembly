%	We show that the Ranicki--Weiss assembly functor from presheaves on a simplicial complex with values on chain complexes to comodules over its Alexander--Whitney coalgebra, is full and faithful after restricting the target to the subcategory of comodules over Steenrod's cup-$i$ coalgebra, a derived $\Sym_2$-equivariant extension of Alexander--Whitney's.

\begin{abstract}
	We show that the Ranicki--Weiss assembly functor, going from presheaves on a simplicial complex with values on chain complexes to comodules over its Alexander--Whitney coalgebra, factors fully faithfully through the category of comodules over Steenrod's cup-$i$ coalgebra, a derived $\Sym_2$-equivariant extension of Alexander--Whitney's.
