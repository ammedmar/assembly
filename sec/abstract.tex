\begin{abstract}
	We show that the Ranicki--Weiss assembly functor, going from chain complex valued presheaves on a simplicial complex to comodules over its Alexander--Whitney coalgebra, factors fully faithfully through the category of comodules over its Steenrod cup-$i$ coalgebra.
%	, a derived $\Sym_2$-equivariant extension of Alexander--Whitney's.
